Curvetopia is an advanced Python project designed to identify, regularize, and beautify 2D curves, transforming raw line art into smooth, polished cubic BÃ©zier curves. The project integrates sophisticated techniques for shape regularization, symmetry detection, and curve completion, allowing for the refinement of hand-drawn shapes and doodles into professional-quality curves. Additionally, Curvetopia provides powerful visualization tools to inspect and fine-tune the results, making it an essential tool for artists and designers who seek to enhance their digital artwork.
